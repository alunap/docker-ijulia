# ijulia_ml

This is a fork by Alun ap Rhisiart of the excellent IJulia container by Angel Rodriquez of Quantum Object. I have modified it to include packages more suitable for statistics and machine learning rather than maths. It includes the DrWatson package, as well as Flux, DecisionTrees, and ScikitLearn for ML, and HypothesisTests, StatsModels, and other statistics packages. Also added PyCall and Pandas for interaction with python, and NBInclude for better usage of Jupyter notebooks.

docker container for [IJulia Notebook][3]

"IJulia is a [Julia-language][6] backend combined with [Jupyter][8]. This combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful [graphical notebook][9], which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document"

This notebook is for the last version in development for Julia if you are looking for the stable version I recomended that used the official docker image from Jupyter:  [jupyter/datascience-notebook][11]   and for more jupyter [docker-stacks][12]

## Install dependencies

  - [Docker][2]

To install docker in Ubuntu 18.04 use the commands:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

 To install docker in other operating systems check [docker online documentation][4]

## Usage

To run container use the command below:

    $ docker run -d -p 8998:8998 --name ijulia alunapr/docker-ijulia

Run the after install script:

    $ docker exec -it ijulia after_install

Need to provide new password.

## Accessing the IJulia applications:

After that check with your browser at addresses plus the port 8998:

  - **http://host_ip:8998/**
  
  and for experimental Jupyter lab : 
  
   - **http://host_ip:8998/lab/**

To access the container from the server running docker :

    $ docker exec -it ijulia /bin/bash

note: Too add extension for JupyterLab you need to install NodeJS and npm by `apt update & apt install nodejs npm ` . Deploy this container behind proxy with SSL for extra security :
